- added a safety confirmation requiring a "y" or "n" to prevent running by accident

UAD Plugins Tool v1.1.0:
- completely redesigned the script to move unused plugins rather than search and permanently delete them. (This allows for the process to run in seconds rather than minutes. Unused plugins now get moved to a folder on the the desktop called "UAD_Backup" which contains the following subfolders: AAX, Component, Documentation, VST, VST_Mono & VST3).
- removed the function to delete the UAD uninstaller, as it's file size is negligible and may help users properly clean up UAD files if they need to use this  
- removed the need to comment out plugin titles under the documentation section in the script. (This is now handled by the section under "# List of plugin names")
- edited Instructions.txt to reflect this new implementation

UAD Plugins Tool v1.0.1:
This update includes time-saving optimizations for searching in plugin folders with thousands of plugins.
- Adds "/Universal Audio" to directory paths to reduce overall search time
- Creates a temporary "Universal Audio" directory for Audio Unit's to avoid searching all plugins in the Components directory
