UAD Plugins Tool 1.1.2:
- added support for UAD Software v11.7.0
- added the new "UAD A-Type Multiband Enhancer" to the list of plugins

UAD Plugins Tool 1.1.1:
- changed the extension of the script to .command instead of a .sh in order to run it simply by double clicking it
- added a safety confirmation requiring a "y" or "n" to prevent running by accident
- added instructions on de-quarantining the script so that it's not automatically blocked by Apple's gatekeeper (due to me not yet being in the paid Apple Developer Program.)
- simplified, clarified & colorized text output
- Updated testing info for macOS Sequoia and UAD Software v11.6.0

UAD Plugins Tool 1.1.0:
- completely redesigned the script to move unused plugins rather than search and permanently delete them. (This allows for the process to run in seconds rather than minutes. Unused plugins now get moved to a folder on the the desktop called "UAD_Backup" which contains the following subfolders: AAX, Component, Documentation, VST, VST_Mono & VST3).
- removed the function to delete the UAD uninstaller, as it's file size is negligible and may help users properly clean up UAD files if they need to use this  
- removed the need to comment out plugin titles under the documentation section in the script. (This is now handled by the section under "# List of plugin names")
- edited Instructions.txt to reflect this new implementation


UAD Plugins Tool 1.0.1:
This update includes time-saving optimizations for searching in plugin folders with thousands of plugins.
- Adds "/Universal Audio" to directory paths to reduce overall search time
- Creates a temporary "Universal Audio" directory for Audio Unit's to avoid searching all plugins in the Components directory
