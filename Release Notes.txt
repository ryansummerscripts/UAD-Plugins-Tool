v2.1:
- Added support for macOS Tahoe 26.0.1
- Added two new menu options:
  · 6) 🔧 Check/Fix Permissions
  · 7) 📚 UAD Resources
- Implemented a permissions check (and optional fix) for cases where a user account may not 'own' plugins directories or have write access to move plugins
- the new 📚 UAD Resources menu option provides quick links to download the latest UAD Software '.pkg' installer (not easily accessible anymore), download previous installers, check the UAD release notes, or run the uninstaller.
- Now automatically cleans up the UAD_Backup folder (that gets created on the desktop) if no plugins were moved - and if nothing exists in the subfolders.
- Removed UAD MDWEQ5 from the plugin list. This extra PDF is now removed automatically when both MDWEQ5-3B & MDWEQ5-5B are uncommented in the plugin list.
- Fixed auto-resizing resulting in unintended window dimensions while Terminal's font size was set to anything other than '14'.
- Added auto-resize support for iTerm
- Added auto-resize support for 4k resolutions (now maxes out screen's height)
- Various other visual enhancements, fixes and optimizations

v1.1.2:
- added support for UAD Software v11.7.0
- added the new "UAD A-Type Multiband Enhancer" to the list of plugins

v1.1.1:
- changed the extension of the script to .command instead of a .sh in order to run it simply by double clicking it
- added a safety confirmation requiring a "y" or "n" to prevent running by accident
- added instructions on de-quarantining the script so that it's not automatically blocked by Apple's gatekeeper (due to me not yet being in the paid Apple Developer Program.)

- Updated testing info for macOS Sequoia and UAD Software v11.6.0

v1.1.0:
- completely redesigned the script to move unused plugins rather than search and permanently delete them. (This allows for the process to run in seconds rather than minutes. Unused plugins now get moved to a folder on the the desktop called "UAD_Backup" which contains the following subfolders: AAX, Component, Documentation, VST, VST_Mono & VST3).
- removed the function to delete the UAD uninstaller, as it's file size is negligible and may help users properly clean up UAD files if they need to use this  
- removed the need to comment out plugin titles under the documentation section in the script. (This is now handled by the section under "# List of plugin names")
- edited Instructions.txt to reflect this new implementation

v1.0.1:
This update includes time-saving optimizations for searching in plugin folders with thousands of plugins.
- Adds "/Universal Audio" to directory paths to reduce overall search time
- Creates a temporary "Universal Audio" directory for Audio Unit's to avoid searching all plugins in the Components directory

v1.0.0:
- Initial Release
